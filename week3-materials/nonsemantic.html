    <div class="big-title">Growing Together: Building Community Through Urban Gardens</div>
    
    <div class="small-text">

    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="section-title">The Challenge We Face</div>
        <div>In many urban neighborhoods, access to fresh, affordable produce remains a significant challenge. Food deserts—areas with limited access to grocery stores offering fresh fruits and vegetables—affect millions of residents, particularly in low-income communities. The COVID-19 pandemic highlighted these disparities, as many families struggled to maintain healthy diets while facing economic uncertainty.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="section-title">Our Solution: Community-Led Gardens</div>
        <div>Community gardens offer a powerful solution that addresses multiple challenges simultaneously. These spaces provide fresh produce, create opportunities for neighbors to connect, and transform underutilized urban land into productive green spaces.</div>
        
        <div style="margin: 20px 0;">
            <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Benefits of Community Gardens:</div>
            <div>• Increased access to fresh, nutritious food</div>
            <div>• Reduced grocery bills for participating families</div>
            <div>• Opportunities for intergenerational knowledge sharing</div>
            <div>• Improved mental health through outdoor activity</div>
            <div>• Stronger neighborhood connections and social cohesion</div>
            <div>• Environmental benefits including air purification and biodiversity</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="sidebar-box">
        <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Success Story: Riverside Community Garden</div>
        <div>The Riverside Community Garden, established in 2019, now feeds 45 families and has become a hub for cultural exchange. "Before the garden, I barely knew my neighbors," says participant John Chen. "Now we share recipes, watch each other's kids, and have built real friendships."</div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="section-title">Getting Started: Your Garden Journey</div>
        <div>Starting a community garden requires planning, but the process can be incredibly rewarding. Here's how to begin:</div>
        
        <div style="margin: 15px 0;">
            <div style="font-weight: bold;">1. Build Community Interest</div>
            <div>Start by talking to neighbors, posting on community boards, and reaching out to local organizations. You'll need at least 8-10 committed participants to ensure success.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin: 15px 0;">
            <div style="font-weight: bold;">2. Identify Suitable Land</div>
            <div>Look for vacant lots, unused corners of parks, or even rooftops. Contact the city planning office to understand zoning requirements and potential partnerships.</div>
        </div>
        
        <div style="margin: 15px 0;">
            <div style="font-weight: bold;">3. Secure Resources</div>
            <div>Apply for community grants, partner with local businesses for tool donations, and connect with gardening organizations for expertise and seeds.</div>
        </div>
    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="section-title">Overcoming Common Challenges</div>
        <div>Every community garden faces obstacles, but these can be addressed with planning and persistence. Seasonal weather variations require covered storage and season extension techniques. Limited water access can be solved through rain catchment systems and partnerships with nearby buildings. Soil contamination in urban areas often requires raised beds and imported soil, which increases initial costs but ensures food safety.</div>
    </div>

    <div class="sidebar-box">
        <div style="font-weight: bold; margin-bottom: 10px;">Get Involved</div>

    </div>

    <div class="content-section">
        <div class="section-title">Looking Forward</div>
        <div>Community gardens represent more than just food production—they're spaces for healing, learning, and building the social connections that make neighborhoods resilient. As cities continue to grow and change, these green spaces offer a model for community-led solutions that address multiple challenges while bringing people together.</div>
        
        <div style="margin-top: 15px;">The seeds we plant today—both literal and metaphorical—will grow into the stronger, more connected communities we need for tomorrow.</div>
